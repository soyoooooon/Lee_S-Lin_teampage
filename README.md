## Written Plan
What I'm writing is that would be a review, not a written plan.
Apparently, I've written two scripts. First one(main.js) was that I was trying to use multidimensional array, and put each array's number. But it didn't work. it just kept saying that arrayIndex is undefined.
Also, I've realized that the one-button has to be the only one function while I wrote this script.

So I started over, made a new script. I'd asked my professor and some friends. someone told me that you would be able to make images array too. Thanks to my professor and some friends.
